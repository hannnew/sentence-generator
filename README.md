# sentence-generator
A sentence generator.

*Including every homeless airport, our obese notebook held no iron.*
*Her rock played despite some wrinkles.*
*Beside my airplane, our zebra painted some fountain.*
*Like their ancient cow, his arrow ran.*
All these and more wait for you in the fantastic world of sentence-generator.

## What do?
SentenceGenerator generates sentences! They're mostly silly nonsense, but they should all be grammatically correct. May be useful for writing prompts and/or general silliness.
Technically, it can generate infinite different sentences due to recursion! In practice, there is a very low chance of an infinitely long sentence. However, it can produce tens of thousands of different sentences, and you can swap in your own word lists too.
As is, when run, it will generate and print 100 random sentences.
